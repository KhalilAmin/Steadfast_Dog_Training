				<i>“So thankful for Rebekah and steadfast training! Jack had a lot of energy and really needed help with door manners and
					a whole list of things. Amazed by Rebekah and what she does. Couldn’t have picked a better person to help with jack!
					I highly recommend her services! 5 stars”</i>

				<i>“Auntie Rebekah is the dog whisperer of Tampa Bay! She took our Labradoodle Max, who was a counter surfing, leash pulling,
					toy eating, furniture jumping, crazy animal, and turned him into a gentle, kind, peaceful rule follower! We are blown
					away by Rebekah’s 2 week board and train program, and her communication via phone calls, pictures, and videos the entire
					time made us truly feel at ease. No longer am I screaming “NO MAX!!!” Thank you Auntie Rebekah and Uncle Mitch, too.
					You are the BEST”</i>

				<i>“Rebekah at Steadfast Dog Training is amazing. She made us feel so comfortable leaving our dog in her care for 12 days
					during the board and train program. Our German Shepherd, Brucey, had a lot of anxiety, pulled when being walked on a
					leash, jumped on people and just didn’t listen. After Rebekah worked with him, his anxiety has gotten better and he
					doesn’t feel as threatened when people walk by him, he hasn’t jumped, and can now walk beside you on and off a leash!
					I was nervous on how I was going to be able to know how to keep up with the commands and training, but Rebekah walked
					us through the entire process at drop off. We are so happy with the results and would highly recommend Steadfast Dog
					training! Thanks Rebekah!”</i>
